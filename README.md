Learning Graphs in Python for DataScience

Things data science projects should have

    Data collection
    Feature engineering
    Trend and high level analysis

Projects that I recommend

    Multiple linear regression or Logistic Regression
    Classification (comparing various models)
    Regression (comparing multiple models)
    Deep Learning (Neural Net)
    Time Series Analysis
    Clustering

What makes a great project

    Advanced data collection (Scraping or collecting data)
    Advanced feature engineering
    Productionized model

Project 1: House Prices Regression (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices...)

Project 2: Titanic Classification (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

Project 3: Deep Learning Number Recognition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recogn...)

These data science projects should be where you start and not featured on your resume. Data science projects that are on unique data sets and that are more advanced will help you get a job. These 3 projects will help you learn the concepts and get you familiar with python.
